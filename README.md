## Name

ldd - Linux device driver examples

## Description

This project is a collection of Linux device driver examples.
Most are unique to this project.  But they are derived from
examples given in books and elsewhere.

A device driver can appear to be complex, when taken as a whole,
but it is from simple concepts.
These drivers emphasize the simple concepts by building a driver
in stages.  Each stage introduces a new concept.
And the changes can between each stage can be concisely
described by looking at the `diff`.
