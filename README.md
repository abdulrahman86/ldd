## Name

ldd - Linux device driver examples

## Description

This project is a collection of Linux device driver examples.
Most are unique to this project.  But many are derived from
examples given in books and elsewhere.

A device driver can appear to be complex when taken as a whole.
But they are built upon simple concepts.
To emphasize this simplicity each driver is built in stages
where each stage introduces a new concept.
And the changes between stages can be easily viewed by looking
at the `diff`.
