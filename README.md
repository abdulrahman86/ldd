## Name

ldd - Linux Device Driver examples

## Description

There are many excellent books about Linux device drivers.
However, in this authors experience, they were difficult to
learn from.  It certainly was not from their lack of detail.
If anything it was from their lack of simplicity.

The drivers described here are the result of the authors
effort to construct examples which are simple and concise.
Each introduces as few concepts as possible.
And each is a fully working example.  Many of the drivers are
built in stages.  Each stage introduces a new concept.  And
the changes are concisely described by the showing the differences (`diff`).
