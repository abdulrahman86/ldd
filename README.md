# NAME

ldd - Linux Device Driver examples

# DESCRIPTION

This is a collection Linux device drivers examples.

Many of the examples were derived from two Linux device
driver books: Linux Device Drivers (2005) and
Essential Linux Device Drivers (2008).

# INDEX

(in order from simple to more complex)

  - hello - "Hello, World" driver, prints a message on load/unload

  - param - "Hello, World" that takes a parameter

The "data" driver simply provides memory that can be read/written.
The driver is built up in steps.  What has changed between steps
can be seen using 'diff'.

    $ cd data_rw
    $ diff data.c ../data_chr/data.c

  - data_chr - creation of a character device, load/unload

  - data_rw - read/write

  - data_sk - seekable read/write

  - ioctx - read/write value using ioctl()

The following null and zero drivers don't introduce any new concepts.
But they do show how to construct these familiar devices using the
techniques shown so far.

  - null - creating /dev/null0 from a char device

  - zero - creating /dev/zero from a char device

(in development)

  - datsem - semaphore controlled data

  - readv, writev

  - mmap

# REQUIRED PACKAGES

To compile these modules under Debian the following
packages had to be installed.  Adjust for your specific
kernel version.

    root# apt-get install linux-source-3.9
    root# apt-get install linux-headers-3.9-1-686-pae

## Compiling Modules

Each of the examples will have a Makefile similar to
the one given below except with the name of that
specific module in place of 'example.o'.


    obj-m := example.o
    
    path := $(shell uname -r)
    
    all:
        echo $(EXTRA_CFLAGS)
        make -C /lib/modules/$(path)/build M=$(PWD) modules
    
    clean:
        make -C /lib/modules/$(path)/build M=$(PWD) clean

With this Makefile typing 'make' should build the module.
And then root can insmod and rmmod the module as usual.

    root# insmod example.ko
    root# rmmod example
