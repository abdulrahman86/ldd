faulty - faulty module with creates a segfault during a read or write

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module can be used to create a segfault which will generate a
backtrace in the logs.  This can be useful when learning how to
understand backtraces.  Since it is know where the fault is in the code,
the task is to determine how the backtrace points to this location.

Be sure to have `CONFIG_KALLSYSM` enabled in the kernel.  Otherwise
the backtrace will be even more incomprehensible.

Read Fault
==========

First, build and load the fault module.

    make
    sudo insmod faulty.ko

Then try to read from the faulty device.

    sudo dd if=/dev/faulty of=/dev/null count=40

A large backtrace will be produced in the logs.

    ...

First, notice that the `RIP` line indicates that the error occurred in
the `[faulty]` module in the `faulty_read` function.

The next thing to notice is that the pattern which was being written with
`memset()` appears on the stack trace.  A unique data pattern is not always
available, but it is an interesting characteristic nonetheless.

    /* Create a buffer overflow fault */
    memset(stack_buf, 0xab, 20);
    
At this point the function inside the module where the fault occurred is known.
But the exact function within this is not known.  Using more information
from the backtrace, along with `gdb`, the fault location can be further narrowed
down.

Refer again to the RIP line (below) in the back trace.

    ...
    Mar 11 00:29:59 frost kernel: RIP  [<ffffffffa00b90a3>] faulty_read+0x53/0x54 [faulty]
    ...

The value `+0x53/0x54` indicates the symbol location and offset.  But these
values are relative to assembler code, not C code, so `gdb` must be used
to translate these values.

First, start gdb with the faulty module.

    sudo gdb faulty.ko
    (gdb)

Before adding the symbol file, the location of the `.text` section in the
faulty module must be determined.  This can be found by reading its sysfs
file.

    cat /sys/module/faulty/sections/.text 
    0xffffffffa0176000

Now add the symbol file from gdb.

    (gdb) add-symbol-file faulty.o 0xffffffffa0176000

Disassemble the `faulty_read` function to see locations referred to by
`+0x53/0x54` in the RIP line.

    (gdb) disassemble faulty_read

But this still doesn't indicate which line in the C source is at fault.
To get a listing, use the `list` command with the address at `+0x53`.
Be sure to include the `*` in the command.

    (gdb) list *0x00000000000000b5
    0xb5 is in faulty_read (/home/jeri/ldd/faulty/faulty.c:69).
    64	{
    65		int ret;
    66		char stack_buf[4];
    67	
    68		/* Create a buffer overflow fault */
    69		memset(stack_buf, 0xab, 20);
    70	
    71		if (count > 4)
    72			count = 4;
    73	
    (gdb)

This points directly to line 69, which was the call which created
the buffer overflow.
